# Greenify
Greenify is an AI-based urban sustainability project that identifies heat-prone city areas using computer vision and visually redesigns them with green infrastructure using Generative AI. The project helps demonstrate how adding greenery such as trees and green roofs can reduce urban heat and support smart, sustainable city planning.
